	<!-- talks about who I am and where I am from -->
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Freshman Engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh.
	<b> <font color="Blue" face="Arial"> H2P!! </font> </b>
	I was originally born in Germany, and I lived there for about few years. 
	When I was 5 my family immigrated to the United States. My family moved 
	to Murrysville, a suburb of Pittsburgh, and has lived there since. I 
	started my education here in the US since I was not old enough to attend 
	school in Germany at the time that we moved.

	<!-- talks about my early years and the start of my education -->
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a lot of trouble with my education when I started attending school. 
	I was still in the process of learning German by the time I went to school 
	in the US. This made it really difficult for me since I was learning two 
	languages at the same time. My parents wanted to make sure that all of 
	their children were still able to speak German and so they insisted that 
	we speak German in our house. This, however, meant that I was getting 
	confused with my languages for a while when I was starting school. I 
	attended Mother of Sorrows for first and second grade but then from 
	third grade on I went to my local public school, Franklin Regional. I 
	really enjoyed my time at Franklin and did a lot of things I consider to 
	be worth while.

	<!-- talks about high school and what my favorite classes were -->
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high school I loved my art classes but also my science and math 
	classes. I really enjoyed art because it allowed me to express myself 
	and I was able to be as creative as I wanted to be. I took many art 
	classes in both 3D and 2D, and I really think it was a great thing to do 
	because they helped shape me to be the person I am today. I also really 
	enjoyed my science classes. I took many science classes but my favorite 
	were physics and chemistry. I also really enjoyed math, mainly because 
	of the teachers, but I learned a lot and actually enjoyed it, too.
