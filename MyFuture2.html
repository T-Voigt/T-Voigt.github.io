	 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plans for the future definitely include becoming 
	 	a Professional Engineer. This means that I plan on becoming licensed. To become 
	 	licensed, I must first finish a 4-year college degree in engineering. I then will 
	 	have to work under a Professional Engineer for at least 4 years. After that I have 
	 	to pass two exams that test me on the knowledge an engineer should know. If all 
	 	goes well to this point, I will then be eligible for my individual states license. 
	 	As soon as I apply and get my license then I will be a licensed professional 
	 	engineer. </br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to become a registered licensed 
		professional engineer because of four main reasons. One reason is that a client 
		will see that I have the credentials of an expert and that I can be trusted to do 
		the work. The second reason is that employers will see that I can take on a higher 
		level of responsibility and that I am a valuable asset to them. The third reason 
		is that by being licensed co-workers will trust and value my opinions and will 
		look up to me. The fourth reason is that I will be happy with myself because the 
		license shows my hard work ethic and my desire to succeed.</br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensed engineers are the reason the world has been 
		able to make the huge leaps forward in technology that we as humans have made. It 
		is the trust that people have in the engineers that brings the world forward. To 
		help continue to bring the world even farther forward than we already have it is 
		important to become licensed. With this license people will trust the engineer and 
		the engineer can invent new revolutionary things that in a few years will seem common 
		because of the speed at which the world is progressing.</br>
