		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering is a link between scientific discovery 
		and commercial application. Engineers are tasked to be this link and for that 
		reason need to apply the principles of science and mathematics. Engineers find 
		and develop solutions to technical problems in practically everything in the 
		world. There are many fields of engineering that create different products but all 
		engineers need to be problem solvers. Some careers in engineering include.</br>
		<ol type="A" start="4">
			<li>Nuclear engineer</li>
			<li>Aerospace engineer</li>
			<li>Automotive engineer</li>
			<li>Biomedical engineer</li>
			<li>Chemical engineer</li>
			<li>Civil engineer</li>
		</ol>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineers need to be able to design, develop, test, 
		produce, and maintain the products that are created. During the designing and 
		development phase engineers need to figure out the overall effectiveness, cost, 
		reliability, and safety of their product. These products can be anything from 
		chemicals to toys. During the testing, producing and maintaining of products 
		engineers must make sure that their products continue to preform like new and if 
		problems arise engineers are tasked to fix them. </br>

		Automotive engineer
	</font></h3>
	
	<p align="left">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automotive engineers are the brains behind the 
		development of passenger cars, trucks, buses, and basically anything similar to 
		these. They design new products as well as modifying existing ones. Automotive 
		engineers must know how to make commercial products that are innovative, 
		effective, and profitable. In order to do this automotive engineers must take part 
		in researching, designing, and developing vehicles and components. As well as 
		doing this automotive engineers must also take into consideration the type of 
		engine the vehicle runs on and with that the possible environmental and safety 
		aspects associated with it. Possible automotive engineering careers include.</br>
		<ol type="i">
			<li>Automotive Manufacturing</li>
			<li>Original Equipment Manufacturing</li>
			<li>Systems & Components Manufacturing</li>
			<li>Engine Manufacturing</li>
			<li>Project manager</li>
		</ol>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Automotive engineering would be a fun and 
		rewarding job for me. I love drawing and painting, as well as 3D art and 
		automotive engineering allows you to work closely with designers to make a 
		rendering become reality. Not only this but also that it is a rewarding job. The 
		automotive world is ever evolving. Every year car manufacturers release new models 
		of cars and keep on making new features for cars. All of the cars and features are 
		created by automotive engineers and I would love to be a part of this fast paced 
		but rewarding engineering field. I truly want to have a career that thrills the 
		senses and automotive engineering would make that a reality.</br>
