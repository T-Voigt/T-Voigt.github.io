		<b>ENGINEERING SAFER CARS</b>
	</font></H2>
	
	<p align="left"> <font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the National Highway Traffic Safety 
		Administration, two out of every three motorists will be involved in an accident 
		resulting in injury during their life time [1]. For this reason, engineers should 
		devote time and resources to automotive safety, which is an important field that 
		is constantly being improved in order to make sure that people are safe behind the 
		wheel. Anthony Foxx, the U.S. Transportation Secretary, said, &quot;We are entering a 
		new era of vehicle safety, focused on preventing crashes from ever occurring, 
		rather than just protecting occupants when crashes happen,&quot; [2]. We are entering 
		this new era due to the invention of automatic emergency braking systems. With 
		this system being installed in many automobiles, the dangers of driving can be 
		reduced dramatically. Automatic braking systems are a breakthrough feature, which 
		allows cars to apply the brakes by themselves when they sense that they might be 
		involved in an upcoming crash [3]. The development for inventions that prevent 
		accidents from ever happening are a new field that can prove to be crucial for 
		the automotive industry in the near future. Nobody likes to be involved in an 
		accident, and being able to prevent this danger would create a better world for 
		everyone. I also consider automatic emergency braking systems to be a 
		revolutionary and important invention to driving safety. This is because I have 
		been involved in an accident where an automatic emergency braking system could 
		have prevented the accident. In the future, I want to work for a car manufacturer 
		and help create safe and reliable cars. Also, I believe that automotive accidents 
		are an inconvenience of driving that could be eliminated with proper inventions 
		and safety systems. This invention will drastically reduce the amounts of 
		accidents on the roads today because it will be able to partially eliminate driver 
		error [2].

		<b>AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM</b>
	</font></H2>
	
	<p align="left"><font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand the benefits of automatic emergency 
		braking systems, one must first understand what exactly this system is. In a car 
		that doesn&lsquo;t have this system, emergency braking is done by the driver. For 
		example, if a car were to suddenly stop in front of me, then it is up to me to 
		slam on the brakes to stop my car before I crashed into the car in front of me. 
		In this situation one must consider the human reaction time to be a factor for 
		this emergency stop to be effective. In the world that we live in, however, there 
		are distractions everywhere and this can cause an increase in our reaction time. 
		In order to keep people safe behind the wheel, engineers should devote time and 
		resources to the invention of safety systems in cars. In a vehicle that has an 
		automatic emergency braking system, the human reaction time is taken out of the 
		equation. Reimagine the same situation as just described, but this time my car 
		does have an automatic emergency braking system. Now my car would come to a stop 
		sooner because my reaction time is no longer a variable in stopping time. The 
		automatic braking system reacts for the driver and automatically applies the 
		brakes when it senses that the car is going to crash [4].

	<H2 align="center"> <font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		<b>How It Works</b>
	</font></H2>
		
	<p align="left"><font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you know what the system is, it is 
		important to know how it works. Each automotive manufacturer that offers automatic 
		braking systems has their own specific system, but the setup is basically the 
		same. The front of the car has a series of sensors that scan the area ahead of the 
		car. These sensors could be lasers, radar, or even video data. In many automobiles 
		the sensors can detect objects up to 250 meters away [5]. The information picked 
		up by these sensors is processed to determine if an object is in the way of the 
		vehicle. If there happens to be an object, the system then calculates the speed of 
		the object in front of the car. If the speed of the object is significantly less 
		than the car&lsquo;s speed, then the computer could determine if a collision or crash is 
		likely. If the computer determines that a collision is likely, it is able to apply 
		the brakes for the driver. This allows the car to significantly reduce its speed, 
		decreasing the severity, or to even prevent the crash from happening all together. 
		This system can save lives and reduce the amount of property damage caused from a 
		collision.

		<b>Reducing Rear-endings</b>
	</font></H2>
		
	<p align="left"><font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main benefits of an automatic emergency braking 
		system are that it can significantly reduce the danger of an accident or prevent 
		the accident from happening in the first place. There are many types of accidents 
		that one can be involved in when driving, but 28% of accidents in the United 
		States are rear-endings [6]. This means that over a quarter of accidents occur 
		when one car fails to brake in time and ends up hitting the car in front of it. 
		Studies determined that in 80% of rear-end accidents the drivers do not use their 
		brakes at all or do not use the car&lsquo;s full braking capacity [5]. Automatic 
		emergency braking systems could prevent most of these accidents from ever 
		happening by applying the brakes for the driver and stopping the car. Automatic 
		braking systems can also decrease the severity of high speed accidents [3]. High 
		speed accidents are more fatal and the automatic emergency braking system would be 
		able to reduce the speed of the car before a high speed crash significantly to 
		help avoid worst case scenario accidents. In a test performed in 2013 by the 
		Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the Highway Loss Data Institute 
		(HLDI), the researchers tested the automatic emergency braking system of a variety 
		of vehicles that were advertised as incorporating this kind of system and ranked 
		them on their performance in a front-to-rear-end crash. To simulate the car being 
		rear-ended, an inflatable model of a car was used to prevent damage to the 
		manufacturer vehicles. The cars were then driven at a speed of 12 miles per hour 
		in the first test and 25 miles per hour in the second test at the stationary 
		model. What the testers found was that the systems were always able to indicate if 
		there was an object with significantly slower speed in front of the vehicle. Also, 
		if the vehicle had an automatic emergency braking system, this system was able to 
		slow the cars down in every test reducing the speed of impact. For many cars the 
		breaking system was even able to stop the car entirely and prevent a collision 
		from occurring at all. This test proved the benefits of having an automatic 
		emergency braking system because it can help prevent accidents or decrease the 
		severity of accidents [7].

		<b>Increasing Pedestrian Safety</b>
	</font></H2>
		
	<p align="left"><font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with rear-ending accidents, there are also 
		crashes that involve pedestrians. These collisions are often very dangerous for 
		the pedestrians and can result in serious injury or death. The National Center for 
		Statistics and Analysis published a report stating that in the year 2013 alone 
		there were 4,735 pedestrians killed and 66,000 pedestrians injured in traffic 
		accidents in the United States [8]. A study indicated that at a 40 miles per hour 
		collision there was an 85% chance of death, at 30 miles per hour there was still a 
		45% chance of death, and at 20 miles per hour there was a significant reduction to 
		a 5% chance of death. This study indicated that the use of automatic emergency 
		braking systems can drastically increase the chance of survival for the pedestrian 
		involved in a traffic accident. One new automatic emergency braking system goes 
		even a step further and combines the use of radar sensors and video cameras, both 
		in the front of the car. This specific system is able to identify and track 
		pedestrians up to 40 meters away. The system also works in crowded urban 
		environments with groups of people and even identifies people using umbrellas in 
		the rain. [9] This last example is still an advancing technology for automakers, 
		but it is great to see that further improvements are being made and that progress 
		continues to go in the right direction of optimizing safety in various traffic 
		situations.

		<b>Importance To Me</b>
	</font></H2>
		
	<p align="left"><font color="white" size="2" face="Arial">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the invention of automatic emergency braking 
		I might not have had to experience being in an accident. I was rear-ended by a 
		pick up truck three years ago, shortly after coming to a stop at a red light. It 
		was not a horrible accident, but it did cause quite a bit of damage to my car. The 
		driver that hit me claimed that he had not noticed the light turning red and for 
		that reason failed to brake. But if his vehicle had been equipped with an 
		automatic braking system, his vehicle would likely not have hit mine. This would 
		have saved both him and me a lot of money. But it isn&lsquo;t just accidents like the 
		one that I was in; there are hundreds of fatal accidents annually that happen from 
		one vehicle rear-ending another vehicle. With automatic emergency braking systems 
		being installed in all vehicles, there is the potential of saving many lives in 
		the U.S. annually and this is very important to me. I value human life 
		tremendously and I hate it when someone dies in a scenario that was avoidable. The 
		invention of the automatic emergency braking system allows lives to be saved with 
		the help of computer input. I am also fascinated by automobiles and would love to 
		work for a car manufacturer in the future. I do believe that driving cars can be 
		very dangerous and I truly want to decrease this danger. I want people to find the 
		same joy in cars that I do and I believe that if cars were seen as being safer 
		than they are now more people would share my viewpoint. For this reason, I am 
		intrigued by inventions like automatic emergency braking systems and would love to 
		make them even better in the future.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering a new era of automotive safety. 
		There are countless inventions being developed that create a safer environment on 
		the roads. The automatic emergency braking system is one of the inventions that 
		provides a safer driving environment. It is an important invention to society 
		because it allows many lives to be saved annually. Automatic emergency braking 
		systems allow vehicles to decrease their speed or even come to a complete stop if 
		the vehicle senses that it will be involved in a crash. This invention is very 
		important to me because I have been involved in an avoidable accident. Therefore, 
		I understand the benefits that such a system can provide. I believe that the roads 
		are a dangerous place. But in the world that we live in, roads are unavoidable. If 
		we can make roads a safer environment, then the world would truly be a better 
		place.
