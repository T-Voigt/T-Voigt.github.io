		The American Society of Mechanical Engineers is a Professional Society that 
		interests me as a future engineer. I want to become a mechanical engineer in the 
		future and being part of this society would provide me with a large number of 
		benefits. Some benefits include networking, and conferences. I want to be successful 
		with whatever I do and I truly believe that by joining a society such as this one 
		I can get closer to my goal.
